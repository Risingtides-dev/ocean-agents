Finished the `ocean-agents` package-side build inventory in
`docs/AGENT_FILESYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`: split runtime foundation work from this
repo's manifest/profile/SOP/contract/verification builds and linked the
Python-to-Rust migration cutover. Verification passed:
`make assistants-check`, `python3 -m unittest discover -s assistants/bridge/tests -v`,
and `python3 couriers/hub/router.py list`.

type: [plan]: Primitive-native status correction
area: [writing]: Architecture doc

Corrected the package-side build register and architecture mirror to state that
`ocean-agents` currently has zero primitive-native builds. Existing artifacts are
now labeled as filesystem conventions or transitional harnesses, with typed
primitive implementation/enforcement owned by `ocean-os`. Verified the TOML
register parses and asserts `primitive_native_builds = 0`; `make assistants-check`
still passes.

worktree: [main]
type: [workflow]: Ocean project map
area: [writing]: Cross-repo documentation

Added `docs/OCEAN_PROJECT_MAP.md` and linked it from the repo entrypoints so
agents can route references across `ocean-os`, `ocean-agents`, `ocean-surface`,
and `ocean-bedrock`. The map keeps runtime enforcement in `ocean-os`, agent
package/profile ownership in this repo, UI surfaces in `ocean-surface`, and
shared knowledge/data-plane ownership in `ocean-bedrock`.

type: [workflow]: Ocean project map
area: [writing]: Cross-repo documentation

Refined `docs/OCEAN_PROJECT_MAP.md` with a pairwise connection matrix so agents
see the four repos as one connected Ocean system. The update calls out this
repo's links to the runtime, surfaces, Bedrock context/handoffs, and all-four
workflow path.

area: [design]: Cross-repo documentation

Linked the mirrored project map to the new animated cartography artifact at
`../../ocean-os/docs/OCEAN_PROJECT_MAP_ART.html`. The artifact visualizes the
four connected repos as an ocean chart with `ocean-agents` as the profiles,
couriers, SOPs, and tools island.

worktree: [main]
type: [workflow]: Phase-0 stabilization
area: [infra]: Repo hygiene

Landed the uncommitted 06-26 session (AGENT_FILESYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE build
register, OCEAN_PROJECT_MAP, AGENTS-CHANNEL roster updates) in one docs commit
on main, and untracked `.cursor/hooks/state/continual-learning.json`
(IDE-generated state, now gitignored). Triaged stash@{0}: the mission brief
claimed it landed via commits 6b4c362/662f354/c589837, but those commits only
touch the CI workflow file — the stash's actual content (event streamer,
autoreply-channel gating, gallery-link delivery, video-gen skill wiring)
doesn't exist anywhere on main, so it was kept rather than dropped. Triaged 3
remote + 4 local branches: 4 provably shipped and deleted
(ci/ocean-328-test-runner-job, fix/reply-partial-canvas-keyerror,
fix/restore-ocean-agency remote+local, all byte-identical to main), 2 boarded
as real unlanded work (design/content-agent-slack-assistant,
wip/bonzai-content-local — the latter is the companion piece to the kept
stash). Full triage record at
`../ocean-discovery/08-branch-triage-ocean-agents.md`. `make assistants-check`
passes clean.

worktree: [main]
type: [merge]: Phase-1 agents-docs-truth
area: [docs]: Spec recovery + README truth-sync

Landed the missing design authority: merged design/content-agent-slack-assistant
(docs-only, one commit) via --no-ff, so
docs/specs/2026-06-04-content-agent-slack-assistant-design.md now exists on main
and the assistants/README.md link plus every §3–§13 bridge citation finally
resolve — the spec had sat unmerged since 06-04 while everything built against
it shipped. Then truth-synced the two READMEs that were lying about repo state:
assistants/README.md and assistants/tools/README.md both still told operators
the compose-check CI workflow was parked at assistants/tools/ci/ awaiting a git
mv, but it has been live at .github/workflows/assistants-compose-check.yml since
OCEAN-327 (6b4c362); and the registry table still labeled content-agent
"scaffold (R5, OCEAN-80)" though the Slack bridge shipped end to end
(socket_listener OCEAN-112, reply, canvas_consumer OCEAN-244/375) — now "live
(Slack bridge; OCEAN-112/244/375)". Branch design/content-agent-slack-assistant
is fully merged and safe to delete. `make assistants-check` green; pushed to
origin/main.
